# predped: An R package to simulate the Minds for Mobile Agents (M4MA) pedestrian model

This project serves as a tool to simulate pedestrian movement using the
Minds for Mobile Agents (M4MA) model. It contains several helper
functions for people who wish to use the model to investigate pedestrian
flow in their own settings. Before delving into how to use the package,
we will first provide the reader with some background on the model.

## Background

Pedestrian models are popular tools to investigate how people navigate
the complex world that we live in. While these models have certainly
been useful to understand, for example, evacuation behavior, they most
often assume that pedestrians are homogeneous – that is, that all
pedestrians are one and the same. Because of this assumption, these
pedestrian models are not suited to capture the variety of walking
behaviors we observe in most low-density situations, such as those
observed in the supermarket, in the train station, or even on the
street.

To alleviate these difficulties, Andrew Heathcote and Dora Matzke
recently proposed M4MA to capture pedestrian movement. This model is
based on the pedestrian model developed by Robin et al. (2009) and,
similarly, proposes that pedestrian movement is determined on three
levels:

- *Strategic level*: Consists of planning where the pedestrian wants to
  go to and via which route. Typically, a pedestrian will have to
  fulfill a goal, which will serve as the destination of the route. To
  get to this goal, pedestrians will walk along so-called “path-points”:
  Waypoints along which the pedestrian can walk, serving as intermediate
  steps to get to their destination.
- *Tactical level*: Once their route is determined, pedestrians will
  still be able to adapt if their original plan does not seem feasible.
  For example, other pedestrians can block your route, which makes
  avoiding the crowd more attractive when trying to get to your goal.
  These adaptations are handled on this level.
- *Operational level*: This final level handles the low-level,
  moment-to-moment decisions about where to walk to. In practice, this
  constitutes a choice between one of 34 movement options, created by 11
  angular directions in which a pedestrian can move (going from -72.5 to
  72.5 degrees) and 3 changes in velocity (deceleration, constant speed,
  or acceleration), with the $34^{st}$ option representing stopping. The
  probability with which a pedestrian will move to a given location is
  determined by a utility function that combines several moving
  components, namely (a) preferred speed, (b) current direction, (c)
  goal direction, (d) interpersonal distance, and (e) blocked angles, as
  well as several social components, namely (a) following a person
  heading in the same direction (follow-the-leader) and (b) walking
  besides someone heading in the same direction (walk-besides-buddy).

Critically, and different from other pedestrian models, M4MA assigns
each pedestrian a “personality”, in that all pedestrians have their own
unique values for the parameters that are defined on the operational
level. These individual differences are implemented in two ways:

- *Qualitative differences*: We define several “archetypes” of
  pedestrians, each of which have different discrete values for their
  parameters. These archetypes were created through trial-and-error by
  the researchers in this project and are contained in *archetypes.csv*.
  In no way should these archetypes be interpreted as ground truth or
  real differences between individuals.
- *Quantitative differences*: Each of the parameter values that are
  defined in the archetypes CSV-file serves as a mean around which each
  pedestrian’s actual parameter value fluctuates. Without going into
  detail, each archetype has their own matrix that contains standard
  deviations for each parameter on the diagonal and correlations between
  parameters on the off-diagonal. These matrices are stored in
  *archetypes_sigma.Rds*.

## How to use

This package allows its users to simulate pedestrian behavior as
expected by M4MA. Users can specify the environment, the characterstics
the pedestrians, and the characteristics of the simulation itself (e.g.,
maximal number of agents, initial conditions,…), therefore allowing for
a great variety of potential research questions that can be answered.
For more information on the workflow of this package, see *Getting
started*.

This package depends heavily on the
[`m4ma`](https://github.com/m4ma/m4ma) package.

## Installation

One can install `predped` through the `remotes` package in the following
way:

``` r
remotes::install_github("ndpvh/predped")
```

To use the package, you should load it through `library`:

``` r
library(predped)
```

## Getting started

Within `predped`, we use a particular workflow.

In the first step, you should define the environment in which you want
pedestrians to walk around. For this, you will use the `background`
class. This S4 class contains slots for the `shape` (i.e., the shape of
the room), the `objects` (i.e., which objects are contained within the
room), and a potential `entrance` and/or `exit`. The `shape` and
`objects` should all consist of instances of the `object` class, that is
they should be either a `rectangle`, `polygon`, or `circle`. The
`entrance`/`exit` should be instances of the `coordinate` class.

A simple example of an environment is the following circular room with a
square placed in the middle.

``` r
setting <- background(shape = circle(center = c(0, 0), 
                                     radius = 2), 
                      objects = list(rectangle(center = c(0, 0), 
                                               size = c(1, 1), 
                                               interactable = TRUE)),
                      entrance = coordinate(c(-2, 0)),
                      same_exit = TRUE)
```

In this chunk of code, the argument `interactable = TRUE` makes sure
that the square in the middle of the room can contain goals for the
pedestrians to fulfill. If none of the objects in the `objects` list are
interactable, then the model will not be able to run. The argument
`same_exit` defines whether the entrance and exit are at the same
coordinate. If `same_exit = FALSE`, then a coordinate for the exit
should also be provided.

It is good practice to visualize what the environment looks like. For
this, we can use the `plot` function.

``` r
plot(setting)
```

Now that we have defined the environment in which pedestrians will walk
around, we have to define the characteristics of the pedestrians and
link these with the environment in what is called a `predped` model.
This is another S4 class with slots `setting` (the environment we just
created), `parameters` (dataframe of parameter values), `archetypes` (a
character string of pedestrians to include), and `weights` (the
probability of each archetype entering the room).

For legacy reasons, the current package works with a dataframe that
contains parameter values for a given “class” of people. One such
dataframe is provided by us in *archetypes.csv* and can be called in the
package through the variable `params_archetypes`. As you can see, this
dataframe consists of different parameter values, as well as a “name”
and “color”. The provided color will be the color that is used to plot
the pedestrians when plotting out the results of the simulation. The
name is what will be used to distinguish between different parameter
sets, and concerns the variable that is selected upon based on the
values of `archetypes` in the `predped` model. For example, if we only
wish to have a simulation with `"BaselineEuropean"`s, then we can
specify the model like.

``` r
model <- predped(id = "my model", 
                 setting = setting, 
                 archetypes = "BaselineEuropean")
```

Of course, you are free to specify whichever combination of archetypes
you wish. Note that if you use more than one archetype and you want the
probability of entering the room to be different for each of those, you
should also provide values to the `weights` slot.

With the model defined, we can now finally simulate pedestrian movement.
For this, we use the function `simulate` as follows.

``` r
trace <- simulate(model,
                  max_agents = 25, 
                  iterations = 50,
                  plot_live = TRUE)
```

In this piece of code, we specify that within this simulation: - There
can only be a maximum of 25 agents in the room; - It can only run for 50
iterations; - We want the pedestrian movement to be plotted to our plot
while running the simulation (disclaimer: This is useful, but runs
significantly slower than when `plot_live = FALSE`).

Once the simulation is done, the variable `trace` will be a list of
different so-called intermediate “states” of the environment. Each state
is another list containing the environment (under slot `setting`) and
the pedestrians themselves (under slot `agents`). If you wish to
visualize this trace, you can again use the `plot` function, this time
with the additional argument `trace = TRUE`.

``` r
plots <- plot(trace, 
              trace = TRUE)
```

The variable `plots` is a list containing a plot for each state in
`trace`.

## Contribute

While this model already came far, there are still many gaps in the
behaviors it can capture. Some of these are currently being implemented,
such as queueing and walking in group. Others may be missing without us
knowing. If you want to give us pointers as to which behaviors should be
implemented next, or if you otherwise wish to contribute to this
project, feel free to reach out to Niels Vanhasbroeck
