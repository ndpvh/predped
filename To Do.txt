There are some things that need to be done in order for the code to be better:
	- Check redundancy
	- Document parameter types and their function
	- Document the code itself: Explain output of the functions
	- More explicit function names
		- In general, the code could be more explicit as well: A lot of things happen at once
	- Unnest many of the functions
	- Put tests on all functions
	- Sort out the different goal functions: See what is actual goals and what is utility
	- Everything is still pretty intensive for the CPU: Could we speed things up a bit more?
		- Especially true for the gifs as well

The Github package `m4ma` could also use some documentation
