Typically, pedestrian fulfill goal, serve destination route. get goal, pedestrians walk along -called “path-points”: Waypoints along pedestrian can walk, serving intermediate steps get destination. Tactical level: route determined, pedestrians still able adapt original plan seem feasible. example, pedestrians can block route, makes avoiding crowd attractive trying get goal. adaptations handled level. Operational level: final level handles low-level, moment--moment decisions walk . practice, constitutes choice one 34 movement options, created 11 angular directions pedestrian can move (going -72.5 72.5 degrees) 3 changes velocity (deceleration, constant speed, acceleration), 34st34^{st} option representing stopping. probability pedestrian move given location determined utility function combines several moving components, namely () preferred speed, (b) current direction, (c) goal direction, (d) interpersonal distance, (e) blocked angles, well several social components, namely () following person heading direction (follow--leader) (b) walking besides someone heading direction (walk-besides-buddy). Critically, different pedestrian models, M4MA assigns pedestrian “personality”, pedestrians unique values parameters defined operational level. individual differences implemented two ways: Qualitative differences: define several “archetypes” pedestrians, different discrete values parameters. archetypes created trial--error researchers project contained archetypes.csv. way archetypes interpreted ground truth real differences individuals. Quantitative differences: parameter values defined archetypes CSV-file serves mean around pedestrian’s actual parameter value fluctuates.
