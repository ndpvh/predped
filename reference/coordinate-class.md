# An S4 Class to Represent Coordinate Vectors

Defines the `coordinate` class, which contains all characteristics of a
coordinate or a single point. WARNING: Niels wants to phase the use of
`coordinate`s out of `predped`, as they greatly hamper the flexibility
of the low-level functions.

## Slots

- `x`:

  Numerical vector denoting the coordinate.
