\title{Evaluate whether edges pass through objects}
\usage{
evaluate_edges(ids, segments, objects)
}
\arguments{
\item{ids}{A matrix of n x 2 identifying the nodes that are connected}

\item{segments}{A matrix of n x 4 containing the (x, y) coordinates of the 
nodes in ids}

\item{objects}{List of objects that are contained in the setting}
}
\value{
List containing the nodes, edges, and edges together with their 
coordinates
}
\description{
This function evaluates whether all connections between the nodes are actually 
specified, or specifically which one's are occluded by the objects in 
the background.
}
\details{
Approach taken is to minimize the time it takes to do these computations:
  - Step 1: Compute the distance between the nodes.
  - Step 2: Find out which nodes are reachable from one another. In other 
            words, if I stand at node 1, can I see node 2?
