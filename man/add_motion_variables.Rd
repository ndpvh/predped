\usage{
add_motion_variables(
  data,
  velocities = c(1.5, 1, 0.5),
  orientations = c(72.5, 50, 32.5, 20, 10, 0, -72.5, -50, -32.5, -20, -10),
  time_step = 0.5,
  threshold = qlnorm(0.25, -2.95, 0.64)/time_step,
  initial_conditions = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Instance of a data.frame containing the data you want to transform.}

\item{velocities}{Numeric vector denoting the changes in speeds as assumed by 
the M4MA. Defaults to \code{1.5} (acceleration), \code{1}, and \code{0.5}
(deceleration).}

\item{orientations}{Numeric vector denoting the changes in orientation as 
assumed by the M4MA. Defaults to \code{72.5}, \code{50}, \code{32.5}, 
\code{20}, \code{10}, \code{0}, \code{350}, \code{340}, \code{327.5}, 
\code{310}, \code{287.5} (note that the larger angles are actually the 
negative symmetric versions of the smaller angles).}

\item{time_step}{Numeric denoting the time between each iteration. Defaults 
to \code{0.5} (the same as in \code{\link[predped]{simulate}}).}

\item{threshold}{Numeric denoting under which observed value for speed the 
cell to which an agent has moved should be put to `0`. Defaults to a value 
based on the observed measurement error in our system.}

\item{initial_conditions}{Logical denoting whether the added columns should 
include the initial conditions (that is, speed, orientation, and position at
the previous time point) alongside their current alternatives. Useful when 
one wants to compute the values of the utility-related variables from the 
data. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\description{
This function adds several motion variables to an already existing dataset. 
These motion variables are then used by \code{predped} to compute utilities, 
allowing for estimations in the long run. The variables that are added are 
speed, orientation, and the cell to which a person moved (as defined by the
M4MA).
}
\details{
The provided dataset should at least have the following columns:
 - \code{x}, \code{y}: Coordinates at which a person was standing at a given 
   time
 - \code{time}: A continuous variable that denotes the time at which the 
   measurement took place.
 - \code{id}: The identifier given to the person whose position was measured.
 - \code{goal_id}: The identifier given to the goal the person had to move 
   towards while their position was being measured.
 - \code{goal_x}, \code{goal_y}: The position of the goal the person had to 
   move to while their position was being measured.
