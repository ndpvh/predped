\arguments{
\item{cell}{The index of the cells to create the cell centers for}

\item{position}{The current position of the object}

\item{velocity}{The current velocity of the object}

\item{angle}{The current direction of the object}

\item{angles}{All discretized options to change the direction}
}
\value{
Matrix of positions for the different cells
}
\description{
Compute the positions of the centers of the cells the agent might move to 
based on the velocity and angle. What happens is that you supply the real-
valued position, velocity, and angle for a specific object, and then create
discretized cell positions based on either changes in velocity (deceleraration, 
continuation, or acceleration) and/or direction.
