\title{Adjust edges of graph to walk on}
\usage{
adjust_edges(from, to, background, precomputed_edges)
}
\arguments{
\item{from}{Coordinate from which to start}

\item{to}{Coordinate at which to end}

\item{background}{The background/setting in which the agent is walking}

\item{precomputed_edges}{Output of `create_edges` in which agent and goal 
are removed}
}
\value{
Matrix containing from, to, and the distance between these coordinates
}
\description{
This function uses the background, goal position, and position of the agent
to adjust a previously computed graph of possible routes along which the agent 
can walk towards their goal. The output is then used to find the shortest path.
