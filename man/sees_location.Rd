\usage{
sees_location(agent, co, objects)
}
\arguments{
\item{agent}{The agent}

\item{co}{A coordinate that will be tested against the agents' point of view}

\item{objects}{The list of objects that can obstruct the view of the agent}
}
\value{
Boolean indicating whether the agent can see the point
(`TRUE`) or not (`FALSE`)
}

more specific functions that allowed agents to see goals (`seesGoal`) or
other agents (`seesMany`). These specific cases will still exist alongside
this more general alternative.
