\title{Change a goal}
\usage{
change(object, ...)

\S4method{change}{goal}(
  object,
  setting = NULL,
  goal_list = NULL,
  counter = function(n) rnorm(n, 10, 2)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Object of \code{\link[predped]{goal-class}} which should be 
replaced by this function.}

\item{...}{Arguments provided to the method implementations of the generic.}

\item{setting}{Object of \code{\link[predped]{background-class}} within which
the goal should be created. Ignored if a list of potential goals is provided.}

\item{goal_list}{List containing instances of \code{\link[predped]{goal-class}}
from which the new goal should be chosen. Defaults to \code{NULL}, triggering 
the generation of a random goal.}

\item{counter}{Function that takes in no arguments and generates 
a single numerical value that will be used as the counter of the goal. 
See \code{\link[predped]{goal_stack}} for details on this argument.
Defaults to \code{\() rnorm(1, 10, 2)}.}
}
\value{
Object of \code{\link[predped]{goal-class}}.
}
\description{
Replaces an existing object of \code{\link[predped]{goal-class}} with an 
alternative object of the same class. The new goal is randomly generated or 
randomly drawn from a list of options (if provided).
}
\details{
This function allows for a dynamical assignment of goals to agents.

\examples{
# Create a goal
my_goal <- goal(position = c(0, 0))
my_goal

# Replace it with a random goal drawn from the environment. For this to work, 
# we first need to create a background as well.
my_background <- background(shape = rectangle(center = c(0, 0), 
                                              size = c(2, 2)), 
                            objects = list(rectangle(center = c(0, 0), 
                                                     size = c(1, 1))))
change(my_goal, setting = my_background)

# Replace with a random goal drawn from a list of different goals. For this
# to work, we first define this list.
goal_list <- list(goal(position = c(-0.5, 0)), 
                  goal(position = c(0.5, 0)))
change(my_goal, goal_list = goal_list)
