\usage{
benchmark(
  x = NULL,
  iterations = 100,
  summarize = TRUE,
  digits = 2,
  progress = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Character or character vector containing the names of the functions 
to include in the benchmark. Functions should be part of the package. 
Defaults to \code{NULL}, denoting that all functions will be tested.}

\item{iterations}{Integer denoting the number of times to repeat each 
function's benchmark case. The higher this number, the longer the benchmark 
will take but also the more accurate the distribution of times will be per 
function. Defaults to \code{100}.}

\item{summarize}{Logical denoting whether to summarize the results of the 
benchmark. If \code{TRUE}, the function will output an HTML file containing 
the summarized results of the benchmark (mean, standard deviation, and 
2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of the times in seconds). If \code{FALSE}, the output
will be a list of lists containing the raw execution times per function and 
per benchmark case for the function. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{digits}{Integer denoting the decimal points to which to round to. 
Ignored if \code{summarize = FALSE}. Defaults to \code{2}.}

\item{progress}{Logical denoting whether to add a progress bar for the 
benchmarks. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
Either a list of lists containing the raw execution times per 
benchmark case per function (if \code{summarize = FALSE}) or an HTML file 
summarizing the results of the benchmark (if \code{summarize = TRUE})
}
\description{
Function that allows users to benchmark predped on their own device. Times are 
measured through repeated assessments with \code{Sys.time()}, providing us 
with a measure of the user-based time for the functions. Importantly, this is
different from pure execution time of the function, which may be less than 
the user time.
