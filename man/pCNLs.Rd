\title{Transform utility to probability}
\usage{
pCNLs(V, muM = rep(1, length(nests)), nests, alpha, mu = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{V}{Summed utility per candidate cell the agent might move to. Output of
`utility`.}

\item{muM}{Transformed nest assocation parameters that denote precision.
Result of the `transform_mu` function. Defaults to `1` for each nest.}

\item{nests}{Not clear yet}

\item{alpha}{Not clear yet}
}
\description{
Takes in the utility for each of the cells that an agent can decide on and
transforms these utilities to probabilities. This quantifies the probability
that an agent will move to a given cell in space.
