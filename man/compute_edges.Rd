\title{Compute the edges within a given setting}
\usage{
compute_edges(
  background,
  space_between = 2.5 * max(params_from_csv[["params_bounds"]]["radius", ]),
  many_nodes = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{background}{Background for which to compute the edges}

\item{space_between}{Space to keep between nodes and objects in the 
environment. Defaults to 2.5 times the maximal possible radius that the agents
can be.}

\item{many_nodes}{Logical denoting whether to create more than the minimal
number of nodes, allowing more flexibility in the agents. Defaults to `TRUE`.}
}
\value{
List containing edges, edges_with_coords, and nodes
}
\description{
This function uses `create_edges` and then deletes agent and goal positions 
from the resulting graph. The output can then be used as precomputed edges, 
increasing the speed of searching for a route.
