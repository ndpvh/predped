\title{An S4 Class to Represent the M4MA model.}
\description{
The `predped` class defines the M4MA model that can be used to simulate 
data from. It contains the setting in which the agents should walk around as 
well as the parameters of those agents. At this moment, only supports the use
of archetypes: Prototypical agents that have a given parameter set.
}
\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{id}}{A character that can be used to identify the specific model defined
by the class}

\item{\code{setting}}{A dataframe containing the objects that define the 
setting in which the agents will walk around}

\item{\code{parameters}}{A dataframe containing the parameters per archetype in its
columns. Defaults to the `params_archetype` dataframe.}

\item{\code{archetypes}}{A vector of names for the archetypes one wants to use in the 
simulation. Defaults to all archetypes in the `params_archetype` dataframe.}

\item{\code{weights}}{A numeric vector containing the probability with which an agent 
can be of a given archetype. The weights should be in the same order as the 
`archetypes` argument. Defaults to an equal weighting of all archetypes in 
`params_archetype`}
