\title{Predict agent's movement}
\usage{
predict_movement(agent, stay_stopped = TRUE, time_step = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{agent}{The agent in consideration}

\item{stay_stopped}{Logical denoting whether agents will predict other agents 
who have stopped to remain immobile. Defaults to `TRUE`.}

\item{time_step}{Numeric denoting the time step taken between iterations in 
seconds. Defaults to `0.5` or half a second.}
}
\description{
Use an agents' current speed and orientation to determine where the agent might 
end up in the next step. This information is used by other agents' in the 
simulation to determine where (not) to go to if they want to avoid collisions.
