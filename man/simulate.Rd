\usage{
simulate(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{The `predped` model that you want to simulate}

\item{...}{Arguments passed on to the \code{\link[predped]{update_state}} function.}

\item{max_agents}{Integer denoting the maximal number of agents that can be 
present in the environment. Defaults to `20`.}

\item{iterations}{Integer denoting the number of iterations to run the 
simulation for. Defaults to `1800`, which corresponds to 15 minutes of 
simulation (each iterations is 500 msec).}

\item{add_agent_after}{Integer, vector of integers, or function that determines 
after how many iterations an agent gets added to the environment. Defaults to 
a function that draws `x` numbers from a normal distribution with mean 60 
(30 sec) and standard deviation 15 (7.5 sec).}

\item{goal_number}{Integer, vector of integers, or function that determines 
how many goals each of the agents should receive. Defaults to a function that 
draws `x` numbers from a normal distribution with mean 10 and standard 
deviation 2.}

\item{goal_duration}{Integer or function that determines the duration of each 
goal. Defaults to a function that draws `x` numbers from a normal distribution 
with mean 10 (5 sec) and standard deviation 2 (1 sec).}
}
\description{
This function allows users to simulate data from their specified `predped`
model.
