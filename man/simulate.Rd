\usage{
simulate(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{The `predped` model that you want to simulate}

\item{...}{Arguments passed on to the \code{\link[predped]{update}} function.}

\item{max_agents}{Integer, vector, or function that defines the maximal number
of agents at each iteration in the simulation. Defaults to `20`.}

\item{iterations}{Integer denoting the number of iterations to run the 
simulation for. Defaults to `1800`, which corresponds to 15 minutes of 
simulation (each iterations is 500 msec).}

\item{add_agent_after}{Integer, vector of integers, or function that determines 
after how many iterations an agent gets added to the environment. Defaults to 
a function that draws `x` numbers from a normal distribution with mean 60 
(30 sec) and standard deviation 15 (7.5 sec).}

\item{standing_start}{Numeric denoting the speed of agents when they start 
moving. Defaults to `0.1`.}

\item{initial_agents}{List of agents with which to start the simulation. 
Defaults to `NULL`, meaning the simulation should start with no agents in the
room.}

\item{initial_condition}{State containing a setting and agents to start the 
simulation from. Defaults to `NULL`, meaning the simulation will start with 
no agents in the room.}

\item{initial_number_agents}{Integer denoting the number of agents that 
the simulation should start out with. Defaults to `NULL`, meaning the
simulation should start with no agents in the room. Ignored if `initial_agents`
is provided.}

\item{goal_number}{Integer, vector of integers, or function that determines 
how many goals each of the agents should receive. Defaults to a function that 
draws `x` numbers from a normal distribution with mean 10 and standard 
deviation 2.}

\item{goal_duration}{Integer or function that determines the duration of each 
goal. Defaults to a function that draws `x` numbers from a normal distribution 
with mean 10 (5 sec) and standard deviation 2 (1 sec).}

\item{precompute_goal_paths}{Logical denoting whether to precompute all path
points beforehand. This means that the agent does not only preplan the way 
towards their next goal, but also to all goals that follow. Defaults to 
`FALSE`.}

\item{order_goal_stack}{Logical denoting whether to order the goal stack based
on the distance of the agent to the goal. Defaults to `TRUE`}

\item{precomputed_goals}{List of goal stacks from which the agent can be 
assigned one. Defaults to `NULL`, meaning that goal stacks should be created
in the simulation.}

\item{close_enough}{Numeric denoting how close (in radii) the agent needs to 
be to an object in order to interact with it. Defaults to `2`, meaning the 
agent can interact with objects at `2 * radius(agent)` distance away.}

\item{space_between}{Numeric denoting the space that should be left between 
an object and the created path points for the agents (in radii). Defaults to 
`1`, meaning a space of `1 * radius(agent)` is left between an object and the
path points agents use in their strategy.}

\item{time_step}{Numeric denoting the number of seconds each discrete step in
time should mimic. Defaults to `0.5`, or half a second.}

\item{precompute_edges}{Logical denoting whether to precompute the path points
on which agents can move. Defaults to `TRUE`.}

\item{individual_differences}{Logical denoting whether variety on the parameters
should be accounted for (even within archetypes). Defaults to `TRUE`.}

\item{plot_live}{Logical denoting whether to plot each iteration while the 
simulation is going on. Defaults to `FALSE`.}

\item{plot_time}{Numeric denoting the amount of time (in seconds) to wait 
between iterations, i.e., the time between updating the plot. Defaults to 
`0.2`.}
