\arguments{
\item{state}{The current state of the simulation}

\item{background}{The setting in which agents are walking around}

\item{stay_stopped}{Logical denoting whether agents will predict other agents 
who have stopped to remain immobile. Is passed on to `predict_movement`. 
Defaults to `TRUE`}

\item{time_step}{Numeric denoting the time step taken between iterations in 
seconds. Defaults to `0.5` or half a second.}

\item{...}{Arguments to be passed on to `update_agent`}
}
\description{
Function that is used in the simulation to update the current state. Loops
over all the agents and updates both agent characteristics and the setting 
in light of the agents actions to achieve their goals.
