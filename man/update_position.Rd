\arguments{
\item{agent}{The agent to move}

\item{state}{The current state of affairs. Importantly, the agent in `agent`
should not be present in that state}

\item{background}{The setting in which agents are walking around}

\item{velocities}{Matrix that contains the change in velocity per cell that 
the agent might move to. Defaults to an 11 by 3 matrix where each row contains
0.5 (deceleration), 1 (same speed), and 1.5 (acceleration).}

\item{orientations}{Matrix that contains the change in orientation per cell 
that the agent might move to. Defaults to an 11 by 3 matrix where each column
contains 72.5, 50, 32.5, 20, 10, 0, 350, 340, 327.5, 310, and 287.5 degrees.}

\item{standing_start}{Numeric denoting the speed of the agent when they 
resume walking after stopping. Defaults to `0.1`}

\item{time_step}{Numeric denoting the time step taken between iterations in 
seconds. Defaults to `0.5` or half a second.}

\item{agent_predictions}{A list containing the predictions of where each agent
might move to}
