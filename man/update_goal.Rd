\usage{
update_goal(
  agent,
  state,
  background,
  standing_start = 0.05 * parameters(agent)[["preferred_speed"]],
  close_enough = 2 * radius(agent),

\arguments{
\item{agent}{The agent to move}

\item{state}{The current state of affairs. Importantly, the agent in `agent`
should not be present in that state}

\item{background}{The setting in which agents are walking around}

\item{standing_start}{Numeric denoting the speed of the agent when they 
resume walking after stopping. Defaults to `0.1`}

\item{close_enough}{Numeric denoting the distance an agent needs to a path 
point or goal in order to interact with it. Defaults to `radius(agent) / 2`}

\item{report}{Logical denoting whether we should report the actions of the 
agent with regard to the goal. Defaults to `FALSE`}

\item{interactive_report}{Logical denoting whether these reports of `report`
should require user input. Defaults to `FALSE`}
}
