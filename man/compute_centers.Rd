compute_centers(
  agent,
  a = 2,
  b = 0.2,
  velocities = matrix(rep(c(1.5, 1, 0.5), each = 11), ncol = 3),
  orientations = matrix(rep(c(72.5, 50, 32.5, 20, 10, 0, 350, 340, 327.5, 310, 287.5),

}
\arguments{
\item{agent}{Object of the \code{\link[predped]{agent-class}}.}

\item{a, b}{Numerics denoting the parameters of the weighting function, where 
\code{a} is used for the power of the function and \code{b} for the slope of 
function. \code{a} is required to be positive and \code{b} should lie between 
0 and 1, where \code{1 - b} denotes the maximal decrease in velocities in 
percentage. The parameters default to \code{a = 2} and \code{b = 0.2}.}

\item{velocities}{Numeric matrix containing the change in speed for an agent
whenever they move to the respective cell of this matrix. Is used to create
the cell positions that the agent might move to, as performed through
\code{\link[m4ma]{c_vd_rcpp}}. Currently limited to having 11 rows (direction)
and 3 columns (speed). Defaults to a matrix in which the columns contain
\code{1.5} (acceleration), \code{1}, and \code{0.5}.}

\item{orientations}{Numeric matrix containing the change in direction for an
agent whenever they move to the respective cell of this matrix. Is used to
create the cell positions that the agent might move to, as performed through
\code{\link[m4ma]{c_vd_rcpp}}. Currently limited to having 11 rows (direction)
and 3 columns (speed). Defaults to a matrix in which the rows contain
\code{72.5}, \code{50}, \code{32.5}, \code{20}, \code{10}, code{0}, \code{350},
\code{340}, \code{327.5}, \code{310}, \code{287.5} (note that the larger
angles are actually the negative symmetric versions of the smaller angles).}

\item{cpp}{Logical denoting whether to use the Rcpp alternative (\code{TRUE})
or the R alternative of this function (\code{FALSE}). Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
Numeric matrix of (x, y) coordinates for each cell
}
\description{
Compute cell centers based on a person's current position and velocity, 
accounting for potential changes in speed and direction. Alternative to 
\code{\link[m4ma]{c_vd}} that accounts for biomechanical limitations in the 
speed one can maintain when turning at a greater angle. Defaults are based on 
Seethapathi et al. (2024), Brown et al. (2020), and Glaister et al. (2007).

# Generate the cell centers with predped
