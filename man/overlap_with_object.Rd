\title{Find cells for which body overlaps with an object}
\usage{
overlap_with_object(agent, state, centers, free)
}
\arguments{
\item{agent}{An agent to be checked}

\item{state}{A list of the current state in the simulation.}

\item{centers}{A matrix containing the location of the centers of the cells
an agent may move to in two dimensions (x and y)}
}
\value{
Logical indicating whether object is in the room and not blocked
by any state.
}
\description{
This function checks whether the cells that an agent can move do not make
the agent's body overlap with an object. In effect, this tests whether the
size of an agent is not too big for the cells that the agent wants to move
to.
