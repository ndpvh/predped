\usage{
to_trace(
  data,
  background,
  velocities = matrix(rep(c(1.5, 1, 0.5), each = 11), ncol = 3),
  orientations = matrix(rep(c(72.5, 50, 32.5, 20, 10, 0, 350, 340, 327.5, 310, 287.5),
    times = 3), ncol = 3),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Instance of a data.frame containing the data you want to transform.}

\item{background}{Instance of the \code{\link[predped]background-class} 
containing the setting in which the data were gathered.}

\item{velocities}{Numeric matrix containing the change in speed for an agent
whenever they move to the respective cell of this matrix. Is used to create 
the cell positions that the agent might move to, as performed through 
\code{\link[m4ma]{c_vd_rcpp}}. Currently limited to having 11 rows (direction) 
and 3 columns (speed). Defaults to a matrix in which the columns contain 
\code{1.5} (acceleration), \code{1}, and \code{0.5}.}

\item{orientations}{Numeric matrix containing the change in direction for an 
agent whenever they move to the respective cell of this matrix. Is used to 
create the cell positions that the agent might move to, as performed through
\code{\link[m4ma]{c_vd_rcpp}}. Currently limited to having 11 rows (direction)
and 3 columns (speed). Defaults to a matrix in which the rows contain 
\code{72.5}, \code{50}, \code{32.5}, \code{20}, \code{10}, code{0}, \code{350}, 
\code{340}, \code{327.5}, \code{310}, \code{287.5} (note that the larger 
angles are actually the negative symmetric versions of the smaller angles).}

\item{stay_stopped}{Logical denoting whether agents will predict others that 
are currently not moving to remain immobile in the next iteration. Defaults 
to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{time_step}{Numeric denoting the time between each iteration. Defaults 
to \code{0.5} (the same as in \code{\link[predped]{simulate,predped-method}}).}
}
\description{
This function does the opposite of \code{\link[predped]{unpack_trace}}. It
takes in a data.frame and return a trace according to \code{predped}s 
requirements. The data.frame should at least have the column names "x", "y", 
"time", and "id", containing the coordinates, times at which the data were 
gathered (in seconds), and the id-number of the person whose data it is.
