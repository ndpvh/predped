\alias{line_line_intersection_rcpp}
\title{Rcpp version of line_line_intersection. Computes the  between several segments. Is a vectorized 
function with minimal loss of time when the number of segments to test 
increases.}
\usage{
line_line_intersection_rcpp(segments_1, segments_2)
}
\arguments{
\item{segments_1}{Matrix with four columns denoting the x- and y-coordinates
that make up the line segment. Should be in order x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2.}

\item{segments_2}{Matrix of line segments that `segments_1` should be tested
with. Should have the same structure as `segments_1`}

\item{return_all}{Logical denoting whether it should return the intersection 
of all segments to each other. If true, will include indicators of which segments
were compared. Defaults to `FALSE`.}
}
\value{
Returns a logical denoting whether any of the segments in
