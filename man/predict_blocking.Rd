\title{Find angles that lead to a blocked path}
\usage{
predict_blocking(agent, state, agent_predictions, velocity = c(1.5, 1, 0.5))
}
\arguments{
\item{agent}{The agent of concern}

\item{state}{List with the current state of the simulation}

\item{agent_predictions}{The predicted trajectories of the other agents}

\item{velocity}{Vector of changes in the velocity that the agent may take.
Defaults to slowing down (0.5), constant speed (1), or accelerating (1.5).}
}
\value{
Cell-named vector of distances
}
\description{
Computes the distance from each cell the agent might move to to the closest
agent that falls within a cone in that given direction.
