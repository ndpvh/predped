\title{Create nodes of graph to walk on}
\usage{
create_nodes(from, to, background, space_between = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{from}{Coordinate from which to start}

\item{to}{Coordinate at which to end}

\item{background}{The background/setting in which the agent is walking}

\item{space_between}{Numeric denoting the space left between each of the 
different nodes. Defaults to 0.5.}
}
\value{
Matrix containing from, to, and the distance between these coordinates
}
\description{
This function uses the background, goal position, and position of the agent
to create all potential nodes along which the agent can plan their route 
towards their goal. The output is then used to find the shortest path.
