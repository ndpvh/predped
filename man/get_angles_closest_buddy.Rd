\title{Nearest Group Member of Pedestrian `n` in the visual of Pedestrian `n`.}
\usage{
get_angles_closest_buddy(
  agent_idx,
  agent_group,
  p_pred,
  orientation,
  centers,
  position
)
}
\arguments{
\item{agent_idx}{Integer scalar indexing the pedestrian in the state.}

\item{agent_group}{Numeric vector with group membership indices of all pedestrians.}

\item{p_pred}{Numeric matrix with shape Nx2 (x & y) containing predicted positions
of all pedestrians.}

\item{orientation}{Numeric scalar indicating heading angle pedestrian `n`.}

\item{centers}{Numeric matrix with shape (33x2) containing (x & y) for each cell centre.}

\item{position}{Numeric vector indicating position (x & y) pedestrian `n`.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector with absolute difference between heading angle and angle from cell centre
        to predicted position of nearest group member of pedestrian `n` (in radians).
}
\description{
Find cells that minimise the absolute difference between heading angle of pedestrian `n` 
and angle from cell centre to predicted position of nearest group member (in radians).
}
\details{
Returns `Null` if pedestrian `n` does not belong to a social group.
