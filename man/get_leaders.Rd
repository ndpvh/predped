\usage{
get_leaders(
  agent,
  state,
  centers,
  only_group = FALSE,
  prefer_group = TRUE,
  pick_best = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{agent}{The agent of concern}

\item{state}{List with the current state of the simulation}

\item{centers}{The centers of all the positions the agent may move to}

\item{only_group}{Boolean denoting whether only people from the ingroup
should be considered as leaders. Defaults to `FALSE`.}

\item{prefer_group}{Boolean denoting whether to prefer people from the ingroup
to be a leader. Defaults to `TRUE`}

\item{pick_best}{Boolean denoting whether to pick the leader that follows your
own objective most closely (i.e., is heading in a similar direction)}
}
\value{
List containing the distances between the agent and the potential
leaders (`"dists"`) and information on the leaders themselves (`"leaders"`),
that is information on the cells they occupy, the angle of disagreement between
their direction and the orientation of the agent, and whether they are a part
of the ingroup.
}
\description{
This function finds directions in which potential "leaders" can be found,
which the agent can then follow.
