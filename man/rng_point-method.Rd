\usage{
rng_point(object, middle_edge = TRUE, forbidden = NULL)

\S4method{rng_point}{polygon}(object, middle_edge = TRUE, forbidden = NULL)

\S4method{rng_point}{circle}(object, middle_edge = TRUE, forbidden = NULL)

\S4method{rng_point}{segment}(object, middle_edge = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of a type that extends \code{\link[predped]{object-class}}.}

\item{middle_edge}{Logical denoting whether the point should lie in the middle
of a random edge. Ignored for circles. Defaults to `TRUE`.}

\item{forbidden}{Numeric indicating forbidden values. For `polygon` and 
`rectangle`, this is the edge number on which the point should not be 
generated. For `circle`, this is either a vector or a matrix of angles between 
which the point should not be sampled (in radians). For the latter, it is 
important to note that the intervals created by the angles should not overlap.
Defaults to `NULL`, or the point can be sampled anywhere.}
}
\value{
Numerical coordinate of a point on the circumference of the object
