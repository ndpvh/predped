\title{An S4 Class to Represent Agents.}
\description{
Defines the `agent` class, which contains all characteristics of an agent. 
Some of these characteristics are time-independent (e.g., parameters and 
set of goals) while others change during each time step in the simulation or 
estimation (e.g., speed and orientation).
