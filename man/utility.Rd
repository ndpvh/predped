\usage{
utility(
  agent,
  state,
  agent_specifications,
  centers,
  background,
  check,
  precomputed = FALSE,
  subject = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{agent}{The agent for whom to compute the utilities}

\item{state}{A list with the current state of the simulation}

\item{centers}{The centers of all the positions the agent may move to}

\item{check}{Boolean denoting the centers the agent can actually move to
(which are not blocked)}

\item{precomputed}{Boolean denoting whether the different parts that make up
the utilities have already been computed. Defaults to `FALSE`.}

\item{subject}{Boolean denoting whether the utilities are subject-based.
Defaults to `TRUE`.}

\item{P_n}{The goal to move to next}

\item{agent_predictions}{The predicted trajectories of the other agents}

\item{iInfo}{Not clear yet}

the parameters of an agent.
