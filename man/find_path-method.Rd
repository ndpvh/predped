\title{Find path to a goal}
\usage{
find_path(object, ...)

\S4method{find_path}{goal}(
  object,
  agent,
  background,
  algorithm = "bi",
  space_between = radius(agent),
  new_objects = NULL,
  precomputed_edges = NULL,
  many_options = FALSE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{agent}{The agent that wants to go to the goal.}

\item{background}{The background/setting that is being used.}

\item{algorithm}{Algorithm to use for creating the path-points. Is provided
to the `get_path_pair` function of `cppRouting`. Defaults to "bi", using 
bidirectional Dijkstra.}

\item{goal}{The goal with which the agent is interacting}
}
\description{
Defines a list of coordinates that create a strategic path to the goal of the
agents.
