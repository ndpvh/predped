\title{Raycasting algorithm}
\usage{
raycasting(coords, x, outside = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{coords}{Matrix of size n x 2 containing the coordinates of the corners
of the object within which the points may or may not lie}

\item{x}{Matrix of size m x 2 containing the coordinates of the points that 
should be checked}

\item{outside}{A logical indicating whether to return \code{TRUE} if the point
is outside the object.}
}
\value{
Logical vector denoting whether each point in `x` lies within or 
outside of the object
}
\description{
This algorithm checks whether a point lies within an arbitrary polygon by
checking the even-odd-rule, which says that for any point (x,y) that lies
within a polygon, the number of times it cross the boundaries of this
polygon when x goes to infinity should be uneven/odd.
}
\details{
This is not the most efficient algorithm, but it might be good to have
as the default, but to specify other algorithms when possible (e.g., for
rectangle, see below).
