\title{Simulate multiple goal stacks}
\usage{
simulate_goal_stack(
  n,
  setting,
  goal_number = function(x) rnorm(x, 10, 2),
  goal_duration = function(x) rnorm(x, 10, 2),
  space_between = 0.5,
  order_goal_stack = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer denoting the number of goal stacks to create}

\item{setting}{List containing all objects in the environment/setting}

\item{goal_number}{Integer, vector of integers, or function that determines 
how many goals each of the agents should receive. Defaults to a function that 
draws `x` numbers from a normal distribution with mean 10 and standard 
deviation 2.}

\item{goal_duration}{Function that defines how the counter for each goal 
should be generated. Defaults to a normal distribution with mean 10 and 
standard deviation 2.}

\item{space_between}{Numeric denoting the amount of space that is needed 
between a path point and an object}

\item{order_goal_stack}{Logical denoting whether to order the goal stack 
based on distance.}
}
\description{
Create multiple goal stacks that can be used in the simulation. Importantly, 
everything is precomputed here, meaning that all paths towards the goals are
already filled out in the simulation.
