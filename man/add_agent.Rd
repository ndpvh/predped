\usage{
add_agent(
  object,
  background,
  goal_number,
  goal_duration = function(x) rnorm(x, 10, 2),
  radius = 0.2,
  standing_start = 0.1,
  close_enough = 2 * radius,
  space_between = radius,
  time_step = 0.5,
  precomputed_edges = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{The `predped` model that you want to simulate}

\item{goal_number}{Integer denoting the number of goals the agent should
receive.}

\item{goal_duration}{Function that determines the duration of each goal. 
Defaults to a function that draws `x` numbers from a normal distribution 
with mean 10 (5 sec) and standard deviation 2 (1 sec).}
