\usage{
add_agent(
  object,
  goal_number,
  goal_duration = function(x) rnorm(x, 10, 2),
  position = NULL,
  standing_start = 0.1,
  space_between = 2,
  time_step = 0.5,
  precomputed_edges = NULL,
  precompute_goal_paths = TRUE,
  order_goal_stack = TRUE,
  precomputed_goals = NULL,
  individual_differences = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{The `predped` model that you want to simulate}

\item{goal_number}{Integer, vector of integers, or function that determines 
how many goals each of the agents should receive. Defaults to a function that 
draws `x` numbers from a normal distribution with mean 10 and standard 
deviation 2.}

\item{goal_duration}{Integer or function that determines the duration of each 
goal. Defaults to a function that draws `x` numbers from a normal distribution 
with mean 10 (5 sec) and standard deviation 2 (1 sec).}

\item{position}{Vector denoting the position of the agent you wish to create.
Defaults to `NULL`, meaning the agent's location will be at the entrance of 
the room.}

\item{standing_start}{Numeric denoting the speed of agents when they start 
moving. Defaults to `0.1`.}

\item{space_between}{Numeric denoting the space that should be left between 
an object and the created path points for the agents (in radii). Defaults to 
`1`, meaning a space of `1 * radius(agent)` is left between an object and the
path points agents use in their strategy.}

\item{time_step}{Numeric denoting the number of seconds each discrete step in
time should mimic. Defaults to `0.5`, or half a second.}

\item{precomputed_edges}{List of nodes and edges that can be used by the 
path-finding algorithms under the hood. Defaults to `NULL`, meaning edges 
have not been precomputed.}

\item{precompute_goal_paths}{Logical denoting whether to precompute all path
points beforehand. This means that the agent does not only preplan the way 
towards their next goal, but also to all goals that follow. Defaults to 
`FALSE`.}

\item{order_goal_stack}{Logical denoting whether to order the goal stack based
on the distance of the agent to the goal. Defaults to `TRUE`}

\item{precomputed_goals}{List of goal stacks from which the agent can be 
assigned one. Defaults to `NULL`, meaning that goal stacks should be created
in the simulation.}

\item{individual_differences}{Logical denoting whether variety on the parameters
should be accounted for (even within archetypes). Defaults to `TRUE`.}
